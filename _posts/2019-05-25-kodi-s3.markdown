It has been nearly two years living at my apartment and I have finally got round to setting up my RaspberryPi as a Media Center again. 
I found myself wanting to listen to music but to lazy to boot up my BluRay Player and insert a CD (first world problems).
Last time I had one Pi running as a [NAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network-attached_storage) and anther running [Kodi](https://kodi.tv/) reading media off the [NAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network-attached_storage).

When my own [NAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network-attached_storage) I always had drive failure on my mind and I was too tight to run a [RAID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAID).
This time I have stepped things up! 
I am storing my media in [S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/Introduction.html) meaning I don't have to worry about drive failures or running out of space.
Admittedly things are a bit slow as every file system request has to go over the network and it is using more internetz.

To do this the PI uses [s3fs](https://github.com/s3fs-fuse/s3fs-fuse) and the [OSMC](https://osmc.tv/) build of [Kodi](https://kodi.tv/) so I could install it.
I still need to set up mounting the bucket when the PI starts, info to do this can be found [here](https://github.com/s3fs-fuse/s3fs-fuse/issues/412).


_Disclaimer: I am storing music I physically own on CD in S3, but I live in the UK which makes this illegal :/_
