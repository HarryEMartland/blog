I have been working for BookingGo for over five years and have bee on a number of different teams.
Currently I am on a team which is building a new platform to replace the old website using the Micro Front End pattern.
We maintain the core services and help teams migrate to the new architecture.

I have previously been on teams working on a customer service system, customer account area and login, a search engine/price aggregator, and inventory applications.
In my previous job I worked on a SWING UI and later a web app for an assaying company.
