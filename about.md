I have been working for BookingGo for over three years and have bee on a number of different teams.
Currently I am on a team which is building a new platform to replace the old website.
The new website is a Micro Front End and the team is working on the core services and helping teams migrate.

I have previously been on teams working on a customer service system, customer account area and login, a search engine/price aggregator, and inventory applications.
In my previous job I worked on a SWING UI and later a web app for a assaying company.

Other things which might crop up on this blog are MX-5's, Swimming, Running, Music, Coffee, and making Bread.
My posting may be a bit sporadic as I go through fazes of doing things and not.
